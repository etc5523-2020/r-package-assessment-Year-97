``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("etc5523-2020/r-package-assessment-Year-97")
```
## Example

### A simple presentation of coronavirus data set:

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(CovidYe)
library(tibble)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(plotly)
library(ggplot2)


```

```{r example, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
as_tibble(coronavirus)
```

### The Daily Situation and Cumulative Cases

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
coronavirus %>% 
  select(date, country, type, cases) %>% 
  group_by(type, date) %>%
  summarise(total_cases = sum(cases)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = type, values_from = total_cases) %>%
  arrange(date) %>%
  mutate(totalconfirmed = cumsum(confirmed),
         totalrecovered = cumsum(recovered),
         totaldeath = cumsum(death)) %>% 
  head(10) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable()

```

### The overall change trend of COVID-19

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
coronavirus %>% 
   select(date, country, type, cases) %>% 
  filter(country %in% c("US", "India", "Brazil", "Russia", "Peru")) %>% 
  filter(type == "confirmed") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = cases, color = country, lable = country)) +
  
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw()


```
